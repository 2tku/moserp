Microservices based Open Source ERP System

Most ERP Systems are incredible big monolithic pieces of software.
For most small companies this is just overkill. If you need for example only a product management application or an inventory management, you have to use it all.

This projects aims at creating small microservices for each area.

See the Wiki for more details.

## Status
